  <p><font color="white" size="4"> ANS. AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of 
    human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
     It encompasses a broad range of technologies and techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing,
      computer vision, and robotics, among others. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, 
      such as visual perception, speech recognition,decision-making, and language translation. It is used across various industries, 
      including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, to automate processes, improve efficiency, and provide insights 
      from large amounts of data.</p></font>

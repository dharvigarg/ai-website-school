  <h2><font color="white">There are many goals of AI. Some of them are listed below</font> </h2>
  <ol>
  <font color="white" size="3" face="arial"> 
<li>Automation: AI aims to automate repetitive tasks and processes that are currently performed by humans.
     This includes tasks in manufacturing, customer service, data entry, and more, allowing humans to focus on more complex or
      creative endeavors.
<li>Decision Making: AI seeks to enhance decision-making processes by analyzing large amounts of data quickly and accurately. 
    This can range from optimizing supply chains and logistics to making medical diagnoses and predicting market trends.
<li>Problem Solving: AI aims to tackle complex problems that may be beyond the capabilities of traditional computing methods. 
    This includes tasks such as natural language understanding, computer vision, and autonomous driving.
<li>Personalization: AI strives to personalize user experiences by understanding individual preferences and behaviors.
     This is seen in recommendation systems for movies, music, products, and personalized content delivery in social media and online
      platforms.
<li>Learning and Adaptation: AI aims to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
     Machine learning algorithms, for example, adapt to new information and experiences to refine their performance.
<li>Human-Robot Interaction: AI seeks to enable natural and intuitive interaction between humans and machines, 
    facilitating collaboration in workplaces and enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities.
